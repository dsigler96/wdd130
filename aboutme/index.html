    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Devin Sigler</h2>
    <p>
        Hello everyone! My name is Devin Sigler and I am a Computer Science major.  I love to read books, listen to music, and play video games.  My favorite author is Brandon Sanderson and my favorite style of music is EDM.  Soon, I'm going to go to Las Vegas to go to EDC, a dance music festival.
        
        I am not married and I don't currently have a job, and that is why I am still in school.  My goal is to finish my Bachelors degree before going into the work force.  I am only taking web design because it is a required course for my major and I don't anticipate using html in the future.

        I have been a member of the church for all of my life and my favorite scripture is Ether 12:27.

        I'm the person in the middle for the photo below.
