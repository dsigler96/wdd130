      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to create a hub for people who play the popular video game Elden Ring a place to look up information for PvP such as weapons, armor, and spells to optimize their builds for
          their characters.  The goal is to make this place a one-stop hub for build creation, tier list information, and matchmaking via online chat rooms or something similar.  FromSoft has made an amazing game
          and I would like to contribute to the community to make it just as good.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p> The audience of this website is the people who enjoy the PvP aspect of the game and I hope to draw them in by offering a tool for theorycrafting and matchmaking.  Typically, sites related to a videogame
          are related to a kind of wiki - where to find an item, stats, etc.  The goal of my website isn't to provide them with that information.  It is to compile all that info and use a calculator to enable people
          to theorycraft their builds and then test them against others.  </p>

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This page would welcome people to the site and redirect them to either the matchmaking page or character builder page.  Its goal is to asthetically pleasing.

      <h3>Character Builder</h3>
      <p>
        The function of this page would have a calculator to plug in stats, items, and your class to determine the damage, armor resistances, and capabilities of your build.

      </ul>
      <h3>Matchmaking</h3>
      <p>
        The  function of this page will be to have some kind of a match making function, divided by rank.  There would be a hidden MMR system tied to each person's account
        on the site and when they log in, they would be able to queue up into matchmaking.  Once the system matches them with a player around their skill level, it would allow
        them to chat between themselves so that they could determine where to meet in game and have their duel.  Both players would then report on the website who won their best 
        of 3 and the ranking adjustments would take place.
